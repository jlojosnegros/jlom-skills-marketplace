  Generate and maintain AI-agent-oriented documentation for a repository:
  a lightweight root CLAUDE.md plus a deep docs/agent-overlay.md, with drift
  detection, freshness scoring, and protection for human-written sections. Use
  when the user wants to create, migrate, draft, or maintain agent docs / an
  agent overlay / CLAUDE.md, detect documentation drift after code changes, or
  check documentation health. Triggers on "/agentdoc", "agent overlay",
  "generate agent docs", "documentation drift", "update CLAUDE.md".

# agentdoc

A Claude Code skill that generates and maintains AI-agent-oriented documentation for any repository.

Combines the context-management structure of `CLAUDE.md + agent-overlay.md` with automatic
drift detection, freshness scoring, and protection for human-written sections.

---

## What it generates

```
repo/
├── CLAUDE.md                      # Lightweight entry point — auto-loaded by Claude Code
├── docs/
│   ├── agent-overlay.md           # Deep reference with drift-detection frontmatter
│   └── .agentdoc/
│       ├── claims.yml             # Verifiable claims registry (commit this)
│       └── status.json            # CI health snapshot (gitignore this)
└── scripts/
    └── agentdoc-check.sh          # CI utility — no Claude Code required for checks
```

`CLAUDE.md` stays under 120 lines and is loaded on every agent interaction.
`docs/agent-overlay.md` is loaded on demand when the agent needs to modify code.
The split keeps the always-on context small while allowing full architectural depth.

---

## Installation

### Automated installation (recommended)

Use `install.sh` to set everything up in one step.

```bash
# Global — skill available in all repos
./install.sh --mode global

# Local — skill available only in one repo
./install.sh --mode local --root /absolute/path/to/repo

# Local + CI utility (also installs agentdoc-check.sh and updates .gitignore)
./install.sh --mode local --root /absolute/path/to/repo --ci-install
```

The script shows a summary of files to create or modify and asks for confirmation
before making any changes. Run `./install.sh --help` for the full option reference.

**What `--ci-install` does additionally:**

- Copies `agentdoc-check.sh` to `<root>/scripts/` and makes it executable
- Appends `docs/.agentdoc/status.json` to `<root>/.gitignore` (if `.gitignore` exists)
- Prints the location of the GitHub Actions and GitLab CI example files

### Manual installation

**Skill (Claude Code):**

```bash
# Global — available in all repos
cp skill.md ~/.claude/skills/agentdoc.md

# Per-repo — available only in this repo
mkdir -p .claude/skills/
cp skill.md .claude/skills/agentdoc.md
```

**CI utility:**

```bash
mkdir -p scripts/
cp agentdoc-check.sh scripts/
chmod +x scripts/agentdoc-check.sh
git add scripts/agentdoc-check.sh
```

**`.gitignore` entry** (add manually or let `--ci-install` handle it):

```
# agentdoc CI artifact (regenerated on every run)
docs/.agentdoc/status.json
```

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Open a Claude Code session in your repo
claude

# 2. Auto-detect phase and run
/agentdoc

# 3. Or run a specific phase
/agentdoc init              # Single overlay (default)
/agentdoc init --mode multi # Multiple overlays, one per subsystem
/agentdoc migrate           # Adopt an existing overlay (no content changes)
/agentdoc draft             # Fill overlay(s) by reading source code
/agentdoc maintain          # Detect and repair drift after code changes
/agentdoc status            # Print health dashboard without modifying anything

# 4. Check health from the shell
./scripts/agentdoc-check.sh status
```

---

## Migrating an existing overlay

If your repo already has a `docs/agent-overlay.md` written manually or by another tool
(codebase-scribe, a custom prompt, etc.), run `/agentdoc migrate` instead of `/agentdoc init`.

The migrate phase **never modifies content**. It only adds the `agentdoc:` frontmatter block.

```bash
claude
/agentdoc migrate
```

**What it does interactively:**

1. Reads all `##` headings in the existing overlay and classifies each as
   _inferred_ (safe to auto-update) or _protected_ (human-written, never touched).
   You confirm or correct the classification before anything is written.

2. Proposes `watch_paths` based on source file references found in the overlay.
   You confirm, add, or remove entries.

3. Assesses `completeness` from the existing content.

4. Adds the `agentdoc:` block to the frontmatter — either prepending a new `---` block
   or inserting the key into an existing one. All section content is left untouched.

5. Initialises `docs/.agentdoc/claims.yml` (empty — claims are not extracted during migrate).

**After migration:**

```bash
# 1. Review the frontmatter — set human_input to reflect existing tribal knowledge
# 2. Check health
./scripts/agentdoc-check.sh status

# 3. Detect any drift since the overlay was written
/agentdoc maintain

# 4. (Optional) Extract claims from the existing content
/agentdoc draft
# draft only fills sections marked '_[To be filled...]_' — existing content is preserved.
```

**What agentdoc auto-detects:**
If you run `/agentdoc` without arguments on a repo that has an overlay without the
`agentdoc:` block, migration is triggered automatically — you will never accidentally
land in draft phase and overwrite existing content.

---

## Multi-overlay mode

Use this when the repo has clearly separated subsystems that need independent drift
tracking. Examples: a node proxy with distinct proxy, TLS, xDS, and observability
domains; a monorepo with multiple workspace members; a platform with separate control
plane and data plane.

### Starting in multi-overlay mode

```bash
claude
/agentdoc init --mode multi
```

The skill analyzes the repo and **proposes** a subsystem list. You provide the **final** list.
Nothing is created until you confirm.

Example interaction:

```
I detected the following candidate subsystems (suggestion only — you decide):

  1. proxy-data-plane  → src/proxy/, src/copy.rs, src/socket.rs
  2. tls-and-crypto    → src/tls/
  3. xds-and-state     → src/state/, src/xds/
  4. observability     → src/metrics/, src/admin/
  5. build-and-testing → Cargo.toml, tests/, Justfile

Please provide your final subsystem list (one per line):
  name: source/paths
```

### What gets created

```
docs/
├── agent-overlay.md              # Hub — index + cross-cutting conventions
├── agent-overlay-proxy.md        # Spoke — proxy data plane
├── agent-overlay-tls.md          # Spoke — TLS/crypto
├── [... one per subsystem ...]
├── STATUS.md                     # Aggregate health dashboard
└── .agentdoc/
    ├── claims-proxy.yml
    ├── claims-tls.yml
    └── [... one per subsystem ...]
```

### Validation before any write

The skill validates all inputs before creating any file:

- Subsystem names: lowercase letters, digits, hyphens; must start with a letter
- No duplicate names
- All source paths must exist in the repo
- No conflicts with existing files

**If any check fails, all errors are reported at once and no file is created.**

### Reactive split (from single to multi)

If you start in single mode and the overlay grows beyond 350 lines during draft,
the skill stops and proposes splitting:

```
The overlay has 387 lines, approaching the 400-line limit.
Potential subsystems I can identify: [list]

Options:
  [s] split — Convert to multi-overlay mode. You provide the final list.
  [k] keep  — Write the single overlay as-is.
```

If you choose split, the same validation and confirmation flow as `--mode multi` applies.
The already-filled content is distributed into spokes — no re-reading of source files needed.

### STATUS.md

In multi-overlay mode, `/agentdoc status` regenerates `docs/STATUS.md` with the
current scores of every spoke:

```markdown
# agentdoc Status

| Subsystem        | Freshness | Human Input | Completeness | Stale Sections  |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| proxy-data-plane | 94/100    | 20/100      | 90/100       | none            |
| tls-and-crypto   | 100/100   | 0/100       | 80/100       | none            |
| xds-and-state    | 75/100    | 30/100      | 95/100       | ## Key Patterns |
```

The CI gate applies the freshness threshold to **each spoke individually** —
one stale spoke fails the gate.

### CI with multi-overlay

`agentdoc-check.sh` detects multi-overlay mode automatically from the hub frontmatter
and checks all spokes. No configuration change needed.

## How it works

### Five phases

| Phase        | When                                       | What it does                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **init**     | No overlay exists                          | Scans repo, creates `CLAUDE.md` + overlay stub(s). `--mode multi` creates hub + spoke structure                    |
| **migrate**  | Overlay exists, no `agentdoc:` frontmatter | Adds frontmatter interactively — never modifies content                                                            |
| **draft**    | Overlay(s) with `completeness < 50`        | Fills inferred sections, extracts claims. Detects if single overlay is too large and offers reactive split         |
| **maintain** | Overlay(s) complete, code changed          | Detects drift, auto-fixes mechanical drift, flags semantic drift. Processes each spoke independently in multi mode |
| **status**   | Any time                                   | Single mode: health dashboard. Multi mode: per-spoke table + aggregate scores, regenerates `STATUS.md`             |

Phase is auto-detected when you run `/agentdoc` without arguments.

### Drift detection

Each `docs/agent-overlay.md` carries a `agentdoc:` YAML frontmatter block:

```yaml
---
agentdoc:
  scan: "c0eb538903d7019b3401d4c399e9641f0e0c4eff" # HEAD at last run
  freshness: 94 # % of watch_paths unchanged since scan
  human_input: 20 # % of content backed by humans — set manually
  completeness: 90 # % of architectural surface documented
  inferred_sections: # sections the maintain phase can auto-update
    - id: module-map
      heading: "## Module Map"
    - id: key-patterns
      heading: "## Key Patterns & Conventions"
  watch_paths: # files monitored for drift
    - "src/server.rs"
    - "src/ports/"
    - "Cargo.toml"
  stale_sections: [] # sections with active review-needed comments
---
```

**Freshness** is computed deterministically:

```
freshness = round(100 × unchanged_watch_paths / total_watch_paths)
```

where "unchanged" means `git log $scan..HEAD -- $path` returns no commits.

### Human section protection

Sections listed in `inferred_sections` can be auto-regenerated.
Sections **not** listed are treated as human-authored and are **never modified** by any
automated phase. If the code they describe changes, the maintain phase adds a
`<!-- agentdoc:review-needed: <reason> -->` comment above the heading and stops.

Add your "What NOT to Do" section, ADR references, and tribal knowledge outside of
`inferred_sections`. They will survive every maintain run.

---

## CI integration

`agentdoc-check.sh` runs without Claude Code, making it fast and cheap for routine gates.

```bash
# Check documentation health (exit 1 if thresholds not met)
./scripts/agentdoc-check.sh check

# Print dashboard
./scripts/agentdoc-check.sh status

# Auto-repair drift via Claude Code, then check
./scripts/agentdoc-check.sh check --maintain
```

**Thresholds (all configurable via environment variables):**

| Variable                          | Default                 | Meaning                    |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `AGENTDOC_FRESHNESS_THRESHOLD`    | `80`                    | Minimum freshness score    |
| `AGENTDOC_COMPLETENESS_THRESHOLD` | `70`                    | Minimum completeness score |
| `AGENTDOC_HUMAN_INPUT_THRESHOLD`  | `0`                     | Minimum human_input score  |
| `AGENTDOC_OVERLAY_PATH`           | `docs/agent-overlay.md` | Path to overlay file       |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_BIN`                 | `claude`                | Path to Claude Code binary |

### GitHub Actions

Two jobs: `check` (MR gate, no Claude Code) and `maintain` (post-merge bot, opens a PR).

```yaml
# .github/workflows/agentdoc.yml
# See ci-examples/.github/workflows/agentdoc.yml for the full file.

- name: Check documentation health
  run: ./scripts/agentdoc-check.sh check
  env:
    AGENTDOC_FRESHNESS_THRESHOLD: 80
    AGENTDOC_HUMAN_INPUT_THRESHOLD: 20
```

> **Required:** `fetch-depth: 0` in `actions/checkout`. Without full history,
> `git log $scan..HEAD` cannot find the scan hash and freshness computation fails.

### GitLab CI

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml — include or copy from ci-examples/.gitlab/agentdoc.yml

agentdoc:check:
  stage: test
  image: alpine/git:latest
  before_script:
    - apk add --no-cache bash
  script:
    - ./scripts/agentdoc-check.sh check
  variables:
    GIT_DEPTH: 0 # equivalent to fetch-depth: 0
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"'
      changes:
        - src/**/*
        - docs/agent-overlay.md
```

Full workflow files including the auto-maintain bot job are in `ci-examples/`.

---

## Typical workflow

### First time

```bash
claude
/agentdoc init      # creates CLAUDE.md stub + overlay stub
# Review watch_paths in docs/agent-overlay.md, adjust if needed
/agentdoc draft     # fills the overlay
# Add "## What NOT to Do" section manually
# Set human_input score in frontmatter (e.g. 30)
./scripts/agentdoc-check.sh status
git add CLAUDE.md docs/ scripts/agentdoc-check.sh
git commit -s -m "docs: add agentdoc agentic documentation"
```

### After a code change

```bash
./scripts/agentdoc-check.sh status   # see what changed
claude
/agentdoc maintain                    # auto-repair mechanical drift, flag semantic drift
# Review sections with <!-- agentdoc:review-needed: --> comments
git add docs/agent-overlay.md docs/.agentdoc/claims.yml
git commit -s -m "docs: update overlay after src/ports/ changes"
```

---

## Claims file

`docs/.agentdoc/claims.yml` stores verifiable facts extracted from the codebase:

```yaml
claims:
  - id: arch-1
    type: pattern # pattern|constraint|technology|data_flow|boundary|decision
    scope: overlay
    claim: "KonfluxServer holds one Option<Arc<dyn Port>> per integration domain"
    source: "src/server.rs"
    provenance:
      origin: inferred # inferred (AI) | stated (human-validated)
      confidence: high # high|medium|low
    stale: false
```

The maintain phase sets `stale: true` on claims whose source file changed, and auto-fixes
claims where the change was mechanical (renamed path, renamed type).

Commit `claims.yml` to git: it makes drift visible in PR reviews and survives session restarts.
Add `docs/.agentdoc/status.json` to `.gitignore`: it is regenerated on every CI run.
